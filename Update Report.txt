  I redid the restaurant classes. I wanted to change it so that everything wasn't a static variable and I could actually make it object
  oriented. I managed to do this for the most part. You can change the object's values from the GUI directly. However I couldn't get
  the creation of objects in the GUI to work how I wanted to I chose to exclude that part of the class and just create the objects
  during runtime but have the user change their actual values during the program. We all chose to undergo and change most of how each 
  class worked, so it was less confusion when looking at the code. We kept the same basic idea of how our GUI would look and feel from the
  original one that I made.
