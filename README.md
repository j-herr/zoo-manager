Our project is a Zoo Management system. Our goal was to create a program where an employee, or manager can access the program and be 
able to run end of the day reports. We figured this would mostly be utilized by "smaller zoos" who didn't have access/money to all 
these big programs where they can keep track of everything. Our program is fairly simple to use. You go through each module inputting 
info like food cost for the animals, and how many meals they eat. Our how much of each menu item at each restaurant that you all sold 
for the day. They all write to a .txt file (bar the restaurant) that will save the data for going back on the data in the future. 
There is also a report class where you can open each file that was written to and view their contents.

**** On the animal class make sure you type the "$" for food cost (Example: $4.00)****

**The Gift shop portion provided with lots of trouble and unfortunately did not get implemented in time for submission.
